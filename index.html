    I'm so glad you decided to stop by!<br>
  I can't properly introduce myself or meet you, but I'm Katherine and this is just going to be a lot of
  information about myself. It's a bit narcissistic I think (why does someone need to write a whole website about themselves?)
  but if you'd like to know stuff about me keep reading.<br><br>
  To get us started...<br>

<h3>Music</h3>
I really love music, both playing and listening to it. I have been playing classical violin for roughly 12 years
and don't plan to stop anytime soon. In 6th grade I started playing alto sax as well and I'm now in my school's
senior jazz band. Recreationally I like to mess around on the guitar and piano but I'm not very good at all.
I play the latter two instruments mainly to recreate the songs of some of my favorite artists. At the moment
I listen to a lot of indie/bedroom pop music and my favorite artists within that genre are Still Woozy,
beabadoobee, Yellow Days, Summer Salt, Ralph Castelli and Ritt Momney. There are so many others that I love
but that seems like a solid start. One of my absolute favorite bands used to be Bane's World but unfortunately
I can no longer listen to their music on any platforms since I don't support sexual assault.

<h3>Animals</h3>
<p>
I'm also a big animal lover. I recently learned that some people are rather indifferent when it comes to the subject
of animals but I still don't understand how that's entirely possible. I absolutely adore animals. I currently have
a dog but used to have 2 hermit crabs and 2 betta fish as well. My dog is a 
<a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/coton-de-tulear/" target="_blank">Coton de Tulear</a> and uncreatively
named Cotton. However, the name does fit quite well so I'm not mad about it. He is lowkey old but you can't 
really tell. I'd attach a picture of him but I have no idea how to do that so I'll just include a few that look
similar. He really is a lot cuter than these other dogs and I'm not just saying that because he's my dog.
Many other sources (including people who don't really like dogs) think he's absolutely adorable. However, this 
is the best I could do. <br><br>

<br><br>
I grew up watching Nat Geo and Animal Planet and I'm pretty sure that is why I like animals as much as I do. 
Most kids like animals but I had every episode of Planet Earth memorized for a while. It is safe to say that 
I have watched every single thing created by Sir David Attenborough at least 10 times.
