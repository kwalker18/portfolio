    <header><h1>Extra Info</h1></header>
    Hello again, I see you decided to read some more (odd choice but ok).<br>
    Although I am incredibly interesting and I bet you were dying to know more about me, I am quite sick of writing
    about myself. Instead, I'll talk about the people that I like and perhaps share some info about those who birthed me.
    <br>
    <h2>My Mother</h2>
    <p>My mother is a <i>fascinating</i> woman however, she works for the government and that is all I will be able to 
    tell you about her. I hope you meet her someday, personally I think everyone should.
    <br></p>
    <h2>My Father</h2>
    <p><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQHNcE48Ptw8Fw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0?e=1598486400&v=beta&t=eAGfIe1Gj57tFghP_d4dGzXmFOn0nFnso_syjqgmDog" alt="Picture of my father">
    <br>My father is also incredible and lucky for you, he works in the private sector! I'm pretty sure that every single
    moment of his life has been unusual in some fashion and there is no way I would be able to accurately recount it all.
     If I am successful in convincing him to write a memoir I'll be able to link that in here later.
    Random fun fact, he used to hold the world record for fastest Rubik's cube solving.<br>He has also lived in NYC
    his whole life and attended Stuyvesant High School, then going on to Dartmouth College. When he was in high 
    school, he was part of the chess team and helped them to win their second national-championship trophy. If you 
    want to read more about that, here is the link to the NY Times article that discusses it: 
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/03/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-kings-of-high-school-chess.html" target="_blank">https://nytimes.com/chesschamps/. </a>
     I would describe him as a fun-loving, kind hearted genius. 
    <br></p>
    <h2>My Friends</h2>
    <p>My friends are fantastic. I love them all so much and in respect to their privacy I will keep their names secret.
     <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Jag9guKYsAD2fJug8" target="_blank">Here</a> are some photos of my friends.
    <br><br>They are also very accomplished and very talented and I will include some of those accomplishments here. 
    <br>One friend won numerous Scholastic writing awards. You can find her 
    name under Gold Key writing on this website:

    <br>She also has four mentions 
    <a href="https://artandwritingnyc.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/2018-consolidated-writing-award-recipient-list.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
    on Page 23.

    One of my other friends is an accomplished track athlete and you can find some of her times on 
    <a href="http://psal.org/" target="_blank">http://psal.org/</a>
    <br>We currently run a club together, Advocating for Disability Awareness (ADA) and hosted a blood drive last year. 
    <br><br>I could list many other accomplishments but I will leave that for another time.</p>
