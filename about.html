        I can't properly introduce myself or meet you, but I'm Katherine and this is just going to be a lot of
        information about myself. It's a bit narcissistic I think (why does someone need to write a whole website about
        themselves?)
        but if you'd like to know stuff about me keep reading.<br><br>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            I really love music, both playing and listening to it. I have been playing classical violin for roughly 12
            years
            and don't plan to stop anytime soon. In 6th grade I started playing alto sax as well and I'm now in my
            school's
            senior jazz band. Recreationally I like to mess around on the guitar and piano but I'm not very good at all.
            I play the latter two instruments mainly to recreate the songs of some of my favorite artists. At the moment
            I listen to a lot of indie/bedroom pop music and my favorite artists within that genre are Still Woozy,
            beabadoobee, Yellow Days, Summer Salt, Ralph Castelli and Ritt Momney. There are so many others that I love
            but that seems like a solid start. One of my absolute favorite bands used to be Bane's World but
            unfortunately
            I can no longer listen to their music on any platforms since I don't support sexual assault.

            <h3>Animals</h3>
            <p>
                I'm also a big animal lover. I recently learned that some people are rather indifferent when it comes to
                the
                subject
                of animals but I still don't understand how that's entirely possible. I absolutely adore animals. I
                currently
                have
                a dog but used to have 2 hermit crabs and 2 betta fish as well. My dog is a
                <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/coton-de-tulear/" target="_blank">Coton de Tulear</a> and
                uncreatively
                named Cotton. However, the name does fit quite well so I'm not mad about it. He is lowkey old but you
                can't
                really tell. I'd attach a picture of him but I have no idea how to do that so I'll just include a few
                that look
                similar. He really is a lot cuter than these other dogs and I'm not just saying that because he's my
                dog.
                Many other sources (including people who don't really like dogs) think he's absolutely adorable.
                However, this
                is the best I could do. <br><br>

                I grew up watching Nat Geo and Animal Planet and I'm pretty sure that is why I like animals as much as I
                do.
                Most kids like animals but I had every episode of Planet Earth memorized for a while. It is safe to say
                that
                I have watched every single thing created by Sir David Attenborough at least 10 times.

    <header><h1>Extra Info</h1></header>
    Hello again, I see you decided to read some more (odd choice but ok).<br>
    Although I am incredibly interesting and I bet you were dying to know more about me, I am quite sick of writing
    about myself. Instead, I'll talk about the people that I like and perhaps share some info about those who birthed me.
    <br>
    <h2>My Mother</h2>
    <p>My mother is a <i>fascinating</i> woman however, she works for the government and that is all I will be able to 
    tell you about her. I hope you meet her someday, personally I think everyone should.
    <br></p>
    <h2>My Father</h2>
    <p><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQHNcE48Ptw8Fw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0?e=1598486400&v=beta&t=eAGfIe1Gj57tFghP_d4dGzXmFOn0nFnso_syjqgmDog" alt="Picture of my father">
    <br>My father is also incredible and lucky for you, he works in the private sector! I'm pretty sure that every single
    moment of his life has been unusual in some fashion and there is no way I would be able to accurately recount it all.
     If I am successful in convincing him to write a memoir I'll be able to link that in here later.
    Random fun fact, he used to hold the world record for fastest Rubik's cube solving.<br>He has also lived in NYC
    his whole life and attended Stuyvesant High School, then going on to Dartmouth College. When he was in high 
    school, he was part of the chess team and helped them to win their second national-championship trophy. If you 
    want to read more about that, here is the link to the NY Times article that discusses it: 
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/03/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-kings-of-high-school-chess.html" target="_blank">https://nytimes.com/chesschamps/. </a>
     I would describe him as a fun-loving, kind hearted genius. 
    <br></p>
    <h2>My Friends</h2>
    <p>My friends are fantastic. I love them all so much and in respect to their privacy I will keep their names secret.
     <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Jag9guKYsAD2fJug8" target="_blank">Here</a> are some photos of my friends.
    <br><br>They are also very accomplished and very talented and I will include some of those accomplishments here. 
    <br>One friend won numerous Scholastic writing awards. You can find her 
    name under Gold Key writing on this website:
    <a href="http://nyccelebratesartandwriting.nyc/gold-key-writing" target="_blank">http://nyccelebratesartandwriting.nyc/gold-key-writing</a>
    <br>She also has four mentions 
    <a href="https://artandwritingnyc.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/2018-consolidated-writing-award-recipient-list.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
    on Page 23.
    <br><br>
    One of my other friends is an accomplished track athlete and you can find some of her times on 
    <a href="http://psal.org/" target="_blank">http://psal.org/</a>
    <br>We currently run a club together, Advocating for Disability Awareness (ADA) and hosted a blood drive last year. 
    <br><br>I could list many other accomplishments but I will leave that for another time.</p>
